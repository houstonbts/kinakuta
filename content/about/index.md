At KINAKUTA we are using cryptographic, communications, and computer technology to build a virtual data and financial haven in the fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta (pronounced Queena-Kootah). Our goals are to promote censorship-free exchange of information, facilitate an anonymous decentralized financial system and encourage the use of digital gold as a reserve currency for global trade.

We look forward to working together to build a brighter future filled with freedom for all of the world's people.
